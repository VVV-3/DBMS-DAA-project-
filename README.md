# DBMS-DAA-project-
Technology is all about helping humans make their daily life activities simple. But, some people
are less fortunate when it comes to technology making their daily lives easy. Hence, we came
up with the idea of creating a DBMS that helps small scale cottage industries to keep better
track of their business records by digitising their business data. Our main intention is to scrape
the old hand-book which is used by these small scale industries, in which they generally
maintain a hand-written copy of their business transactions.
